PREREQUISITES for offloading binary garbage
============================================

Create directories:
  C:\Users\Public\Linger
  C:\Users\Public\Linger\vs

From any solution root, run:
  junction .vs C:\Users\Public\Linger\vs\<unique_name_related_to_solution>
For example, for SKLib solution, inside directory ....\SKLib, run: junction .vs C:\Users\Public\Linger\vs\sklib


CHANGE section
==============================

A. All Configurations / All Platforms
-------------------------------------

1. Configuration Properties

  a) General
Output Directory       = $(PUBLIC)\Linger\$(ProjectGuid)\$(MSBuildProjectDirectoryNoRoot)\$(Configuration)_$(Platform)\bin\
Intermediate Directory = $(PUBLIC)\Linger\$(ProjectGuid)\$(MSBuildProjectDirectoryNoRoot)\$(Configuration)_$(Platform)\

variant for projetcs that must have all binaries in one place (like DLLs)
Output Directory       = $(PUBLIC)\Linger\bin\$(Configuration)_$(Platform)\

C++ Language Standard  = ISO C++20 Standard

(!) NOTE: For Library
Set Output Directory equal to Intermediate Directory


2. Advanced

Character Set - Review - Prefer: Not Set (ASCII/UTF-8)


3. C/C++

  a) General
Additional Include Directories = $(SolutionDir);$(SolutionDir)\..
Debug Information Format       = Program Database (/Zi)

  b) Output Files
Assembler Output         - consider: Assembly, Machine Code and Source
ASM List Location        = $(OutDir)asm\$(TargetName)\


4. Linker

  a) General
Enable Incremental Linking = No

  b) Debugging
Generate Debug Info = Generate Debug Information optimized for sharing and publishing (/DEBUG:FULL)
// comment: in Release mode, it doesn't increase size

Generate Program Database File = $(IntDir)bin\$(TargetName).pdb

  c) Optimization
Profile Guided Database = $(IntDir)$(TargetName).pgd


B. Release Only / All Platforms
-------------------------------------

1. Configuration Properties

  a) General
Output Directory       = $(SolutionDir)\_release\$(PlatformShortName)\
// replaces what was set earlier

2. C/C++

  a) General
Treat Warnings As Errors = Yes

  b) Optimization
Favor Size Or Speed      = Favor fast code


3. Librarian

  a) General
Treat Lib Warnings As Errors = Yes


3. Linker

  a) General
Treat Linker Warnings As Errors = Yes

  b) Optimization
Link Time Code Generation = Use Link Time Code Generation (/LTCG)


4. Resource
Null Terminate Strings = Yes





EXTERNAL PACKAGES section
==============================

1. Configuration Properties

  a) VC++ Directories

Environmental variables are accessed by expression: $(VARIABLE)
Example of directory reference: $(ADD_ON_PACKAGES)\OpenCV\include

Include Directories - ALL
  Add references to external packages as needed
  Include source is likely the same for all variants

Library Directories - Per Config
  Different platforms and/or targets may require different library directories


2. Librarian

  a) General
Additional Dependencies - Per Config


3. Linker

  a) Input

Additional Dependencies - Per Config
  Add external libraries to be linked to the project
